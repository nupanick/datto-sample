# datto-sample
A sample coding assignment for an interview with Datto (September 2015).

Here is the original problem statement. My solution notes are below.

# Problem

In some English words, there is a letter that appears more than once. Search through a sample of text to find the word with a letter that is repeated more times than any other letter is repeated in any other word. When there is a tie between two words, choose the word that appeared first in the sample.

The text sample will contain only alphabetic characters (“a” through “z” and “A” through “Z”), whitespace, and punctuation marks. The words will be separated by whitespace. A letter is considered to be the same letter regardless of whether it appears in uppercase or lowercase. Any punctuation marks should be ignored—so, in particular, contractions, possessives, and hyphenated words count as a single word.

Each sample is stored in a text file: Write a function that accepts a file path as its argument, and returns the chosen word as its output.

# Example:

*Input:* “O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?”

*Output:* “wherefore”

Explanation: The letter “e” is repeated three times in the word “wherefore”—and this is more than any other letter is repeated in any other word!

# Example:

*Input:* “Some people feel the rain, while others just get wet.”

*Output:* “people”

Explanation: Both “people” and “feel” have a letter that is repeated twice within the word. 

This is a tie—and the first word wins!

# My Solution:

First, I noticed that the only thing that matters in each word is its "repeat index", which is how I will refer to the number generated by counting the repetitions of the word's most common letter. The only things I should worry about storing while reading the text are the current high scoring repeat index, and the first word that reached that score.

Next, I wanted to make sure I parsed each word correctly, ignoring capitalization and punctuation (although it would be humorous to see a word like "y'all'd've" be the top score, with the apostrophe being its "most common letter", this is probably not in the spirit of the assignment). Removing capitals is relatively easy with str.lower(), but getting rid of the punctuation took a little work. Eventually, I decided what I really wanted was a whitelist of just letters, which is what string.lowercase gives me.
